# Notes #

## History ##
- Javascript was developed in 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape.
- Microsoft adopted their own version of Javascript calling it JScript.
- Standardization of Javascript was established by an orgaization called ECMA Interational by 1997.
- ECMAScript is the same as Javascript, and the name can be used interchangeably, since the name "Javascript" is owned by Netscape, Microsoft and Netscape agree upon the name ECMAScript.
- By 1993, ECMAScript 3 came out expanding the language to include RegEx and Exception Handling.
- In 2009, ECMAScript 5 came out making JSON the primary data layer and provided many JSON handling methods.
- ES2015 is ES6, the 6th iteration of Javascript and the largest change in Javascript since its initial offering.
- Because not all browsers handle ES6, you would use tools such as Babel to transponder ES6 code to ES5 code.

## Variable Scope
- Variable used to only be declared using `var` which creates a variable in the global namespace.  ES6 allows to newer ways to declare variables, `let` and `const`
